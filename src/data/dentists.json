I'd suggest you come early at about four a.m to book you slot and then come again a bit later so you can get service quick. However I would not recommend going as I got a tooth extracted today. It was one of the most painful experiences. There was no assurance of what to expect. I was told to not scream or grab by the nurse who showed me no support. The tooth was practically ripped out. They put a numbing injection but I felt every ounce of pressure when my tooth got taken out. Which apparently, you are well not supposed to feel anything when you get an extraction and it's your right to ask for more numbing solution. I was unaware of this as it was my first time. Everything else was smooth sailing but the patient care was abysmal at best. I will never go to a government facility for that. I would rather just find the money to pay for proper care",

Made an appointment on Friday 19 July using their WhatsApp phone number and everything was confirmed with all of the documents sent. I decided to go in person (because it's the closest dentist from my place of residence currently) to check and confirm if my appointment is all set and I'll be in for a consultation to be told they don't see any appointment done but they can see on their WhatsApp everything being confirmed and had to reschedule ( keep in mind I'm missing my lectures, I'm missing work). Rescheduled the appointment for Wednesday 29 July at 1:30 pm and upon arrival I was told the Dentist needs to cancel the appointment because she is stuck in Tygerberg and won't make it. I went to a different walk in dentist for consultation and X-Ray and was told a root canal needed to be done but they don't provide the service. I went back to Smilepro to book an appointment for a root canal and all details were confirmed for Monday 29 July only to be called in the morning of 29 July to be told that my medical aid hasn't confirmed by which I called my medical aid and they insisted NO AUTHORISATION WAS REQUESTED and made a 3 way call with Smilepro and they insist they sent the details and medical aid provider asked for their working email so that they can authorise everything and Smilepro DENIED that they have an email for my appointment to be set.",

The dentist, Rihanna, replaced it with another one, tip of the range. The problem is that it would only last in my poor mother's mouth for 2 days and it would fall off again. My attempts to get an appointment were super frustrating. The \"manager\" never returned my calls and when I finally got hold of him one day, he said he was in a meeting and would call me back. He didn't. I would have to personally attend at the rooms to make the appointment to rectify the situation. This happened 3x. Eventually I went to another dentist who has had to re-do the whole procedure. This time, correctly. In addition, the dentist's room is dark and rather dingy. The chair looks as if it was bought at an auction a few decades ago. I got the sense that the whole place needed a good spring clean. All in all, a very unpleasant experience, mostly for my mother.",
